<h3>MATH 5803: Short Paper (Due Fri Oct 9)</h3>

For students enrolled in 5803, the first paper will be due in class Fri Oct 9.
You are to write a short paper surveying one topic or problem on number theory
which you find interesting, provided it is not something we will be doing
this semester.  For instance, it may be about the status or history of an 
unsolved or recently solved problem, or it may be about a well-known classical 
result in number theory.  It may be elementary or advanced.
<b>However, you must clear the topic with me in advance.</b>
Suggested places to hunt for topics are the list of problems I gave in the
first lecture, the discussion sections in the book and other number theory
texts.

<p>
The paper will be graded on clarity of exposition and mathematical content.
It is a good idea to include one or more examples for concreteness, and to
explain at least a little, the history of the topic.

</p><p><b>Requirements</b>

</p><ul>
<li>
Your paper must be written in some form of TeX (preferably LaTeX or AMSTeX).
Here is a tex file template, which you should use as a basis (in particular,
do not change the first two lines).

<p>
<a href="http://www2.math.ou.edu/~kmartin/nti/template.tex">Template file</a>
</p><p>

If you do not have LaTeX on your computer, you should pick one LaTeX package
and install it.  There are several LaTeX tutorials and references available
online, but I included some basics above in the template file.  If you have
any trouble with LaTeX, feel free to ask me.
</p><p>

</p></li><li> The paper should be about 3 to 5 pages long, not counting any figures
or references.

<p>
</p></li><li> As in the template file, you should list all references you used
and cite in the paper where you used them.

<p>
</p></li><li> You must clearly define all your notation.

</li></ul>


<h3>MATH 4803: Short Paper (Draft Due Fri Dec 11 in class; Final Copy Due Fri Dec 18 at NOON)</h3>

The requirements for this paper are the same as for the MATH 5803: Short Paper
(see above), EXCEPT that you need not write the paper using TeX.  However, I 
will give you a 10 point bonus if you do write your paper in TeX.  If you
use (La)TeX please use the above sample tex file as a template (for the 
formatting).  If you do not use TeX, write your paper in using between a 10
and 12 point size font, single-spaced with roughly 1-inch margins on the side.
You should include references at the end, and your primary references should
be published sources (not online).

<p>
A draft is due of the paper Fri Dec 11th in class.  This draft need not be
complete; if it is incomplete, please summarize what else you plan to include.
The draft will not be graded---I would just like to give you some comments
and suggestions before you turn in your final copy.

</p><p>
Your final copy is due Fri Dec 18th at 3PM.  I plan to submit grades
by the end of the day, so late papers are not acceptable.  You may either turn
it into me in person on Wed during the final exam, or slide it under my office
door by Friday noon.  Please let me know if have any questions.

</p><h3>MATH 5803: Long Paper (Draft Due Fri Dec 11 in class; Final Copy Due Fri Dec 18 at NOON)</h3>

The requirements are the same as for your short paper, except that the
topic should be somewhat advanced, and the paper should be roughly between
12 and 20 pages.
